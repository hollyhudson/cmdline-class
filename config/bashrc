# .bashrc by holly, last modified 15 feb 2015
#
# This file configures the shell for noninteractive logins.  In other words,
# when programs use shell commands.  A program like make will be expecting
# a vanilla shell with no aliasing, and may produce unexpected behavior if
# the commands it has are aliased to use certain parameters automatically.
# 
# For everyday use by a human (interactive shells) make your changes in 
# .bash_profile.  The .bash_profile file should source this file, but this
# file should not source .bash_profile.

# This sets the default permissions for new files
# umask 066 means that other users may not modify or read your files
# but may execute them where appropriate (for example, they can change
# to subdirectories of your home directory).
umask 066

# Where to find your commands and executables
