# The .bash_profile file should source this file, but this file should
# not source .bash_profile.

# This file configures the shell for noninteractive logins.  In other
# words, when programs, rather than humans, use shell commands.  A
# program like make will be expecting a vanilla shell with no aliasing,
# and may produce unexpected behavior if the commands it has are
# aliased to use certain parameters automatically.  For everyday use
# by a human (interactive shells) make your changes in .bash_profile.

# umask sets the default permissions for new files
# umask 066 means that other users may not modify or read your files
# but may execute them where appropriate (for example, they can change
# to subdirectories of your home directory).
