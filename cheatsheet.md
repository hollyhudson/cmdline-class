## Command Line Cheat Sheet

Folders are called directories in Unix.
[Brackets indicate optional input.] Don't type the brackets.

Note: You can always put a path in place of a fileName.  For example:
```bash
cp notes css/mynotes 	# make a copy of notes, put it in css, call it mynotes
```

Many (not all) commands have a version and a help option:
```bash
someCommand --version
someCommand -v
someCommand --help
someCommand -h
```


Tasks:
```bash
open . 				# opens finder with the current dir in focus
open [fileName.jpg] # opens the image in preview, works with pdfs
