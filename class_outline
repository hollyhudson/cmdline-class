ssh key-gen to make it easy to ssh
change bash_profile to enable colors for linux

Instructor set up tasks:

- On the pi:  clone a practice home directory for each user, and use useradd (see below) to set up all the home directories.  THEN go in and chmod u-r the "quote" file in their home directory so they have to change permissions to view it.

The useradd command can reference /etc/skel for a template of what a user home directory should look like -- so first step is to go set up a model home directory in there.

- During the class you will also log in as a user so the students can follow along and see exactly what you see.  This means that if you don't like the .bash_profile I made, you'll want to go edit that before cloning the user directories.

- In your known_hosts, remove the entry for the gibson (Pi) so you
get the same error the students will get when you try to ssh.

- Print cheatsheets for the students
- make username/passwd sheets of paper so everyone can get on the pi and the instance


todo:
- edit the .ssh/config file and place it in the right place
- check permissions after opening zip on pi
- run all commands as a user on the pi

find an interesting log to tail 
cat tail /dev/input/mice
also try:
cat /dev/input/mice | /dev/fb0

Finder beside the terminal for basic navigation

tab completion and ^ for previous command

file system structure and the home and root directories

## Explore:
	ls, cd, cat, less (veryLongFile, search for cookie), file

## Tasks:
	touch, nano (add items to the grocery_list), cp todos todays_tasks
	mv:
		less wrongName, mv wrongName rightName
		run file on hedgehog, mv to hedgehog.jpg, move into images
	redirection:
		cat grocery_list and shopping_list
		touch errand_list
		cat grocery_list > errand_list	
		cat shopping_list > errand_list	(discuss noclobber)
		cat shopping_list >> errand_list
	rm:
		less junk, rm junk
		look inside junkyDir, move out of it, then rm -r (-ri for asking) junkyDir
	clear

## Get Info:
	find and grep:
		find . -name '*.js'
		grep -r -i "good" *

	ls -Flah (aliased to ll), uname -a, du, df, history, ps aux, ps aux | grep -i Chrome (or something), top -o cpu, pgrep

	kill, and mention shutdown


## Permissions:

	try to open the quote file, then change permissions, then try again
	chmod u+r (or a+r) quote

permissions, users, root, groups historical context

ssh - get on the pi

look around

bash config files - show how to replace the one on your computer, and go through the files to talk about the options

Review:

Can you:
- in one command, put a list of all the files in your home directory into a file called myList?
- find the command you ran 6 commands ago?
- find the process number for your login and kill it
- now log back in

terms:
- recursive
- regular expressions, *

Installing stuff:
- tldr
- trans
- git prompt


Shell scripting:
- write saynl.sh, chmod so you can run it, check with ll, is ~/bin in your path?

mkdir public_html, and place index.html style.css and interaction.js in it.

Digital Ocean instance:

- sudo to edit main web page on instance to add a link to your own  (you'll need to find the root password from another clue)

Pi:

- create another user account
