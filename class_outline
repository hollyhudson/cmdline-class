Review:

Can you:
- in one command, put a list of all the files in your home directory into a file called myList?
- find the command you ran 6 commands ago?
- find the process number for your login and kill it
- now log back in

terms:
- recursive
- regular expressions, *

Installing stuff:
- tldr
- trans
- git prompt


Shell scripting:
- write saynl.sh, chmod so you can run it, check with ll, is ~/bin in your path?

mkdir public_html, and place index.html style.css and interaction.js in it.

Digital Ocean instance:

- sudo to edit main web page on instance to add a link to your own  (you'll need to find the root password from another clue)

Pi:

- create another user account
