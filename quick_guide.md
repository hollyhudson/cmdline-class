# Intro to the Command Line

## Basic Structure of a Command

```
> command argument1 argument2 argument3[enter]
```

Arguments can be flags (settings for the command), filenames, paths, or strings.

If your filename has a **space**, it will be treated like two arguments.  To prevent this you have to "escape" the space with a backslash.  So if you want to run a command on a file called `cute kitten.jpg` you have to do:

```
> command cute\ kitten.jpg
```

If you want to pass a string that has spaces, you can enclose it in quotes:

```
> say hello
> say "hello world"
```

## Filesystem Navigation

**ls**  
	list files
**file [fileName]**  
	show file type
**less [fileName]**  
	a "pager" that shows contents of fileName (`q` to quit)
**cd [directoryName]**  
	change directory to directoryName
**cd**  
	with no arguments you'll go to your home directory
**cd ..**  
	go back to the parent directory
**cd -**  
	go back to where you were before you ran cd the last time
**pwd**  
	print working directory

If you lose your prompt, try `ctrl-c`.

## Manipulating Files

### Creating, Deleting, and Moving Files

__cp [originalFileName] [copyFileName]__  
	copy (duplicate) a file
__mv [oldFileName] [newFileName]__  
	move (rename) a file
__rm [fileName]__  
	remove (delete) a file, use with caution
__touch [fileName]__  
	make a new, empty file, or update the timestamp on an existing file
__mkdir [newDirName]__  
	make a new, empty directory
__cp -r [originalDir] [copyDir]__  
	copy (duplicate, recursively) a directory, if copyDir exists it will now contain the contents of both directories
__mv [oldDir] [newDir]__  
	move (rename) a directory, if newDir exists oldDir will be placed inside newDir
__rm -rf [dirName]__  
	remove a directory, recursively, force it, be VERY careful with this command

### File Redirection

- `cat [fileName]` - print contents of fileName to the screen (like less, but not as nice)
- `cat [thisFile] > [thatFile]` - overwrite thatFile with the contents of thisFile, unless "noclobber" is set
- `cat [thisFile] >> [thatFile]` - append the contents of thisFile to thatFile
- `echo "Here is some content" > [fileName]` - overwrite fileName with the content in quotes, unless "noclobber" is set
- `echo "Here is some content" >> [fileName]` - append what's in quotes to fileName
- `[command] > [fileName]` - send the output of the command to the file
- `ls > [fileName]` - fileName now contains a list of files
- `source [thisFile]` - execute commands in thisFile in this shell, useful for loading your bash config file
- `nano`
- `vi`

### Permissions

- `chmod a+r [fileName]` - give all users read permission
- `chmod a+rwx [fileName]` - give all users read, write, and execute permission
- `chmod a-x [fileName]` - remove execute permission for everyone
- `chown [user] [fileName]` - give ownership of fileName to user
- `chown frodo rings/the_one`

### Symlinks

- `ln -s [originalFile] [symlinkFile]` - create a file that is just a link to another file
- `ln -s ~/dotfiles/bashrc .bashrc` - make your .bashrc a symlink to the file in your dotfiles directory

## Getting Information

### About Commands

- `ls -Flah` - list all files with all the details (aka "long list")
- `which [command]` - shows you the path to the command, no output means either the command is not installed or it is not in your path
- `man [command]` - show the manual page for the command (try man shutdown, for instance)
- `[command] --version`
- `[command] --help`
- `tldr [command]` - more beginner-friendly than `man`, but it doesn't come standard, you'll need to download and install it

### About Files

- `file [fileName]` - show file type
- `less [fileName]` - a "pager" that shows contents of fileName (`q` to quit)
- `find [dirName] -name ['kitten.png']` - find files recursively in dirName
- `find [dirName] -name '*.png'` - find all png images in dirName
- `grep [string] *` - show files in current directory that contain the string
- `grep -iR [string] [dirName]` - show files in dirName that contain the string, case-insensitive, recursively
- `grep [string] [dirName]` - show files in dirName that contain the word (or number or whatever)
- `grep ['string with spaces'] [dirName]` - show files in dirName that contain the phrase

### About Your Computer

- `uname -a` - print (all) information about the computer
- `top` - list all process with memory and cpu usage (like Activity Monitor on the Mac or Task Manager on Windows)
- `top -o cpu` - sort by cpu usage
- `ps aux` - list all currently running processes
- `ps aux | grep -i Chrome` - list all running processes with Chrome or chrome in the name
- `du -h [dirName]` - show sizes of all files in dirName with human-readable units (useful if you're trying to delete large files because you've run out of space)
- `df -h` - show an overview of filesystem space usage with human-readable units

### About the Network

- `ping [url]` - see if a server or site it up, will also report connection quality
- `traceroute [url]` - report the path from your computer to the site or server

### About Your Environment

- `jobs` - list all processes your user is currently running (see bg & fg)
- `history` - list previously run commands (what did I just do??)
- `echo "hello there!"` - print stuff to the screen
- `echo [$ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE]` - print the value
- `echo $PATH` - prints the path bash uses to find commands for you

### About Other Things

- `date`
- `cal`
- `cal 1752` - what's up with Sept?

## Actions

### Installing Things

- `brew install [command]` - on mac
- `apt-get install [command]` - on Debian and Raspbian
- `apt-get install git` - for example

### Stopping Things

- `ctrl-z` - suspend the process that's in the foreground (put it to sleep ðŸ’¤)
- `ctrl-c` - kill the process that's in the foreground
- `ctrl-d` - send an "end of file".  Last thing to try when you can't exit a program.  If you type it when nothing is running it will log you out.
- `bg` - run the process you just stopped in the background
- `fg` - bring a process in the background back to the foreground
- `jobs` - list all the suspended commands
- `fg %2` - bring suspended job number 2 back to the foreground
- `kill %1` - kill the suspended job number 1
- `kill [pid]` - tell the process to end.  If this doesn't work, use -9 flag
- `kill -9 [pid]` - tell the operating system to kill the process immediately
- `killall "Chrome"` - kill all processes with Chrome in the name
- `shutdown -h +10` - shutdown (halt) the computer in 10 minutes
- `shutdown -h now` - shutdown the computer now
- `shutdown -r now` - reboot the computer now
- `reboot` - Raspberry Pi only
- `clear` - clear the screen, does not clear your history

### Git

- `git clone [paste from github]` 
- `git pull` 
- `git status` 
- `git add [file1] [file2]` 
- `git commit -m "comment on what has changed with this commit"` 
- `git push` 

### Mac Only

- `say "some phrase"` - speaks the text
- `[command] | say` - speaks the output of the command
- `open [fileName]` - will open the file with the appropriate app, unzipping if necessary
- `open [path]` - will open the directory specified.  Try `open .` and `open /`

## Remote Administration

### Logging In and Out

- `ssh-keygen` - generate an rsa key to use when logging in to a remote machine.  It will be saved in `~/.ssh/` Remember your passphrase if you want to log in again
- `ssh [username]@[hostname]` example: `ssh holly@myDomain.com`
- `ssh [username]@[ipAddress]` example: `ssh holly@192.168.1.32`
- `ssh -l [username] [hostname]` example: `ssh -l holly myDomain.com`
- `passwd` - helps you reset your password, does not help you remember it
- `exit` - logout
- `~.[enter]` - to restore your prompt after logging out if ssh hangs

You can set nicknames for hosts in `/etc/hosts` if you're feeling brave.

### File Transfer

- `scp [from] [to]` - securely copy a file from one machine to another
- `scp [fileName] [server]:[destinationDir]` - from your local machine to the server
- `scp [server]:[filePath] [destinationDir]` - from the server to your local macine
- `scp [server]:[filePath] .` - from the server to your current directory
- `scp myFile 192.168.1.32:/home/holly/` - example, copy myFile to my home directory on a Raspberry Pi
- `scp myFile myServer.myDomain.com:/home/holly/` 

On a Mac you can drag and drop a url from your browser onto the command line, so you don't have to type it.

- `curl -O [url]` - download the file at the url, keeping it's name
- `curl -o [newName] [url]` - download the file at the url, renaming it
- `curl -O --continue [url]` - if you can't download the file because the connection keeps getting interrupted, `--continue` will make `curl` start again where it left off as soon as the connection is reestablished
- `tar`

### Superuser

- `sudo [command]` - run the command as root

### Users and Groups

The following commands must be run as root or with `sudo`.

- `useradd -m [username] -p [password]` - add a user and assign them a password

The user can then log on and use the `passwd` command to change their password.

- `groupadd [groupname]` - add a group
- `usermod -a -G [groupname] [username]` - put a user in a group, (append the user to the group)

## Odds and Ends

### Running Multiple Commands

`&&` runs commands sequentially, so:

- `[longRunningCommand] && say "I'm done"`

Pipe `|` "pipes" the output of the first command into the second command.

`ls | less`
	is useful for directories with so many files they scroll off the screen  

### Typing Less

- `!!` - bang-bang, run last command (same as up-arrow)
- `[command] !! - run the command with the arguments of the last command
- `file /long/path/to/file/do/not/want/to/type/again` - shows file type of `again`
- `rm !!` - deletes the file `again` referenced in the previous command 
- `sudo !!` - run the last command as root (this one is so useful some people alias it to "oops" or more colorful words  
- `![string]` - run the command that is or starts with [string] exactly as it was run the last time (for when you don't want to type all the arguments again)
- `!205` - run the command number 205 from your history

## When Things Go Wrong

- `q` - some commands quit on `q` (like less)
- `ctrl-c` - quit current progam
- `~.[enter]` - if you just quit ssh or lost your ssh connection and don't have a prompt
- `stty sane` - if everything is weird, this sets the terminal configuration to something reasonable
- `ctrl-d` - send end-of-file (last resort because it might log you out)
- Abandon ship -- just close the terminal and open a new one. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
